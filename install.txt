So this ZIP file contains all the required files.

To run this we can either use
1)Localhost
2)WEB SERVER(I have used "www.swapnildarmora.comlu.com") for this 

HOW TO USE THESE FILES(on localhost)

1)Install XAMPP and copy the extracted folder internproblemstatement in your C:>xampp\htdocs

2)Modify the contents of all the file wherever mysql connection is used in given  php files
  this needs to be replaced  $conn=new mysqli("mysql12.000webhost.com","a1703319_swapnil","elnino9");
  by this $conn=new mysqli("localhost","user","password");   Note:(user=username of your sql and password is password )

 3)Modify all the links from say  "www.swapnildarmora.comlu.com/xyz.php" to "http://localhost/internproblemstatement/xyz.php" 
and "www.swapnildarmora.comlu.com/xyz.html" to "http://localhost/internproblemstatement/xyz.html" 
in the given php files and html files

4)Run all the sql commands on your sql server  (provided in sql.txt file)

5)Run from browser http://localhost/internproblemstatement

HOW TO USE ON WEB SERVER

 Copy all the files on your web server and make following changes in files and your sql database
1)Modify mysql command mentioned in step 2 in previous(using on localhost) (use your server ,username and password in all the files)
2)Modify all the links from say  "www.swapnildarmora.comlu.com/xyz.php" to "yourdomainname/xyz.php" 
  and "www.swapnildarmora.comlu.com/xyz.html" to "yourdomainname/xyz.html"
